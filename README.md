# NLP-Basics
This comes out of a graduate level class at UT Austin, CS-388, Natural Language Processing. The idea is to create a repository of NLP building blocks, so that newcomers, can know the interface of using different standard Libraries and creating their own. Overall it is to make life easier. The work is in constant progress and no longer complete.

## Implementation
1. Language Modeling -> N-gram model (Forward, Backward and Bidirectional)
2. Sequence Labelling -> Comparative analysis of Hidden Markov Model (Generative model) and Conditional Random Fields (Discriminative model) for the task of Part of Speech Tagging
3. Statistical Parsing -> PCFG Statistical parsing using Stanford NLP Parser library and additional implementation of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
4. Word Sense Disambiguation -> Coming Up
5. Semantic Role Labelling -> Coming Up
6. Semantic Parsing --> Coming Up
7. Machine Translation --> Coming Up

## Collaboration
I would like to take it a step further. If you have some baseline implementation of a concept, we can collaborate to clean it and put it here for other newcomers to use as a resource for building up their knowledge in Natural Language Processing. The task is to give them an end to end implementation, so that they can understand not just the algorithm, but also how it works. I am very willing to build up this project, and my aim is to make it the best resource for all starter implementation of NLP models.
